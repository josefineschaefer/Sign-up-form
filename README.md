# HTML & CSS Challenge | Sign up Form 

To practise HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript, in this project, I build a sign up form based on a design by [@violetadev](https://github.com/violetadev) as part of a coding challenge & mentorship. 

## Original Design

<img alt="login form on left side, colorful drawing on right side" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/372be2bf-d31b-4c21-98b4-f6b1af7a2651"> 

## Result - Desktop

## Result - Mobile
